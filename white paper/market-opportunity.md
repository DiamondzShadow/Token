# Market Opportunity

#### **The Entertainment Industry Landscape**

The global entertainment industry, valued at over **$2.3 trillion** in 2023, is dominated by centralized entities such as production studios, streaming platforms, and advertising networks. These players monopolize decision-making, revenue generation, and profit distribution, leaving creators and audiences with minimal influence or share in the financial success of the projects they support.

**Key Issues in Traditional Media:**

1. **Centralized Control:** Studios and executives make all creative and operational decisions, limiting diversity and audience input.
2. **Revenue Hoarding:** Platforms like YouTube and Netflix retain the majority of ad revenue and subscription fees, offering creators only a fraction.
3. **Limited Scalability for Creators:** Independent creators face significant challenges in funding, distribution, and audience building.
4. **Lack of Transparency:** The distribution of revenue and allocation of funds remains opaque, leaving contributors unsure of their impact.
