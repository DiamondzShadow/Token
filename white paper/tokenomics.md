# Tokenomics

## SDM Token Overview

The Diamondz Shadow Token (SDM) is the native utility token of the Diamondz Shadow ecosystem, designed to align incentives among all participants and enable the decentralized governance of our content creation platform.

- **Token Name**: Diamondz Shadow Token
- **Token Symbol**: SDM
- **Blockchain**: Diamondz Shadow (OP Stack Layer 2)
- **Token Standard**: Optimism Superchain
- **Initial Supply**: 1,000,000,000 SDM
- **Maximum Supply Cap**: 1,250,000,000 SDM
- **Initial Circulating Supply**: 100,000,000 SDM (10%)

## Cyclical Supply Management

SDM implements an innovative cyclical supply management mechanism to ensure long-term sustainability and value preservation:

1. **Expansion Phase**:
   - Tokens are minted through Proof of Contribution up to the maximum cap of 1.25 billion
   - Minting follows a controlled schedule based on ecosystem activity and contribution

2. **Contraction Phase**:
   - When the total supply reaches 1.25 billion tokens, a burn event is triggered
   - 500 million tokens (40% of supply) are burned from the liquidity supply
   - This reduces total supply to 750 million, creating scarcity and allowing the token to "breathe"

3. **Renewal Phase**:
   - After the burn event, minting resumes based on contribution
   - The cycle repeats when the cap is reached again

This cyclical mechanism provides several benefits:
- Prevents unlimited inflation
- Creates predictable scarcity events
- Maintains healthy liquidity levels
- Protects individual token holders from forced burns
- Ensures economic sustainability over the long term

## Token Allocation

The initial supply of 1 billion SDM tokens is allocated as follows:

| Category | Allocation | Tokens | Vesting |
|----------|------------|--------|---------|
| Community Rewards | 40% | 400,000,000 | Released through Proof of Contribution over 10 years |
| Ecosystem Development | 20% | 200,000,000 | 2-year cliff, then 3-year linear vesting |
| Team & Advisors | 15% | 150,000,000 | 1-year cliff, then 4-year linear vesting |
| Initial Liquidity | 10% | 100,000,000 | Immediately available |
| Treasury | 10% | 100,000,000 | Governed by DAO |

## Tokenomic Mechanisms

### Proof of Contribution Mining

Our unique Proof of Contribution system distributes new tokens based on valuable contributions to the ecosystem:

- **Content Creation**: Producing original content (scripts, visuals, music)
- **Curation**: Identifying and promoting quality content
- **Promotion**: Expanding audience reach and engagement
- **Technical Contributions**: Code, infrastructure, and technical support
- **Community Building**: Moderation, education, and support activities

The contribution mining rate follows a controlled schedule:
- Year 1: 80,000,000 SDM
- Year 2: 72,000,000 SDM
- Year 3: 64,800,000 SDM
- And so on, decreasing by 10% each year until the cap is reached

### Liquidity-Only Burn Mechanism

The cyclical burn mechanism works as follows:

1. **Trigger Condition**: Total supply reaches 1.25 billion SDM

2. **Burn Source**:
   - Burns are applied ONLY to the liquidity supply
   - No tokens are burned from individual user wallets
   - 500 million tokens (40% of total supply) are removed from liquidity pools
   - This approach protects individual holders while maintaining scarcity

3. **Execution**:
   - Smart contract automatically executes the burn
   - Tokens are removed from designated liquidity pools
   - Tokens are sent to a null address (0x000...dead)
   - Event is recorded on-chain with full transparency

4. **Post-Burn Adjustment**:
   - Brief pause in new token issuance (7 days)
   - Gradual resumption of contribution-based minting
   - Adjusted parameters based on ecosystem health

This liquidity-only burn approach ensures that:
- Individual token holders never lose their tokens to burns
- Market impact is managed through controlled liquidity reduction
- Long-term holders are rewarded as scarcity increases
- The ecosystem can continue to reward new contributions

### Liquidity Management

To ensure market stability during the cyclical supply management:

1. **Protocol-Owned Liquidity**: Treasury maintains significant liquidity positions
2. **Liquidity Reserves**: Strategic reserves maintained to support post-burn stability
3. **Gradual Burn Implementation**: Burns are executed gradually to prevent market shocks
4. **Dynamic Fees**: Adjustable fees to incentivize liquidity during burn events
5. **Pre-Burn Notification**: Community is notified before burns to allow for preparation

## Economic Sustainability

The SDM token economy is designed for long-term sustainability through:

1. **Value Capture**:
   - Platform fees flow to token holders and treasury
   - Content revenue creates buy pressure for token
   - NFT royalties generate ongoing returns

2. **Value Accrual**:
   - Governance rights become more valuable as platform grows
   - Cyclical burns create predictable scarcity
   - Utility expansion increases token demand

3. **Circular Economy**:
   - Viewers pay creators in SDM
   - Creators stake earnings and participate in governance
   - Treasury funds new content that attracts more viewers

## Risk Management

To mitigate common tokenomic risks:

1. **Volatility Protection**:
   - Strategic token reserves for market stabilization
   - Dollar-cost averaging for treasury operations
   - Controlled liquidity burns to prevent market shocks

2. **Centralization Resistance**:
   - Contribution-based distribution prevents wealth concentration
   - Quadratic voting to balance influence
   - Transparent burn implementation

3. **Regulatory Compliance**:
   - Legal classification as utility token
   - Transparent governance and treasury management
   - Compliance with relevant securities regulations

4. **Economic Attacks**:
   - Sybil resistance in contribution measurement
   - Slashing conditions for malicious actors
   - Multi-signature requirements for critical functions

By implementing these tokenomic principles with our innovative liquidity-only cyclical supply management, the SDM token creates a sustainable economic model that aligns incentives across all participants in the Diamondz Shadow ecosystem, from content creators to viewers to investors.
