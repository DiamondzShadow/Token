## Cyclical Supply Management

Our ecosystem implements innovative cyclical supply management across all tokens to ensure long-term sustainability:

### Universal Cyclical Mechanism

1. **Expansion Phase**:

1. Tokens are minted through Proof of Contribution up to maximum caps
2. Minting follows controlled schedules based on ecosystem activity



2. **Contraction Phase**:

1. When total supply reaches maximum cap, burn events are triggered
2. 40% of tokens are burned from liquidity pools only
3. Individual user wallets are never affected by burns



3. **Renewal Phase**:

1. After burn events, minting resumes based on contribution
2. Cycles repeat to maintain economic sustainability
