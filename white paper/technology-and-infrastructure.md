# Technology and Infrastructure

#### **Blockchain Architecture**

SDM is deployed across multiple blockchain networks to ensure accessibility, scalability, and inclusivity. These include:

1. **Ethereum:**\
   The most established blockchain, providing robust security and decentralization for SDM’s core infrastructure.
2. **Binance Smart Chain (BSC):**\
   A cost-effective alternative to Ethereum, offering faster transaction speeds and lower fees.
3. **Polygon:**\
   A layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum, enabling high-speed transactions with minimal costs, ideal for smaller contributors.
4. **Base:**\
   A newer chain optimized for scalability and ecosystem integration, allowing SDM to tap into emerging Web3 communities.

**Benefits of Multi-Chain Deployment:**

* **Interoperability:** Users can access SDM tokens across multiple chains without being restricted to one platform.
* **Cost Efficiency:** Low fees on BSC and Polygon make SDM accessible to a broader audience.
* **Scalability:** Multi-chain functionality ensures the ecosystem can handle high transaction volumes as it grows.
