# How to Participate

#### **Overview**

The SDM ecosystem is designed to be inclusive, empowering everyone—whether they are blockchain enthusiasts, creatives, or general supporters—to engage with the platform. Participation spans multiple roles, from token holders and voters to content creators and investors.

Here’s how you can actively participate and contribute to the growth of Diamondz Shadow Movies and the SDM ecosystem.

#### **1. Buy SDM Tokens**

**Purpose:**\
SDM tokens are the foundation of the ecosystem. Holding SDM allows you to engage in governance, stake your tokens, and earn rewards while contributing to liquidity.

**How to Get Started:**

* SDM tokens can be purchased on leading decentralized exchanges (DEXs), such as Uniswap, PancakeSwap, and others.
* Cross-chain accessibility means you can buy SDM on Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain (BSC), Polygon, or Base, depending on your preference and transaction cost considerations.

**Benefits of Holding SDM:**

* Access to governance voting rights.
* Eligibility for staking rewards.
* The ability to participate in exclusive token-holder events or NFT drops.

**Example Use Case:**\
A user buys SDM tokens on Polygon due to its low transaction fees. They hold these tokens to vote on upcoming projects and later stake their tokens to earn passive rewards.

#### **2. Stake SDM Tokens**

**Purpose:**\
Staking allows token holders to earn passive income while supporting the ecosystem’s liquidity and stability. Rewards for staking are funded by ad revenue, NFT sales, and ecosystem profits.

**How to Stake:**

* Connect your Web3 wallet (e.g., MetaMask, Trust Wallet) to the SDM staking platform.
* Choose a staking pool based on your desired lock-in period and reward structure.
* Lock your SDM tokens in the pool to start earning rewards.

**Types of Staking Pools:**

1. **Flexible Staking:** Tokens can be withdrawn at any time, but the rewards are lower.
2. **Locked Staking:** Tokens are locked for a specific period (e.g., 30, 60, or 90 days) in exchange for higher rewards.

**Benefits of Staking:**

* Earn rewards while holding SDM tokens.
* Contribute to liquidity, ensuring smoother trading and reduced price volatility.

#### **3. Submit Creative Work**

**Purpose:**\
SDM empowers creatives by offering opportunities to contribute scripts, visuals, soundtracks, and other production-related content. Contributors are rewarded with SDM tokens based on the quality and impact of their submissions.

**How It Works:**

* Visit the **Creative Submission Portal** on the SDM platform.
* Upload your contribution (e.g., script idea, storyboard, artwork, soundtrack).
* Token holders vote on submissions, and the most popular ideas are approved for production.
* Approved contributors are rewarded with SDM tokens proportional to their impact.

**Examples of Creative Submissions:**

1. A writer submits a script idea for an upcoming web series. If approved, they earn SDM tokens and see their concept brought to life.
2. An artist contributes concept art for a short film, earning SDM tokens and recognition from the community.

**Incentive Model:**

* Submissions that directly impact high-revenue projects receive additional rewards.
* Contributors may also receive NFTs tied to their approved content, representing their creative legacy within the ecosystem.

**Weighted Voting:**\
Votes are weighted based on the number of SDM tokens held, ensuring proportional influence while preventing monopolization by a single user.

#### **5. Participate in Community Events**

**Purpose:**\
Community events are a cornerstone of the SDM ecosystem, fostering collaboration and engagement while rewarding participants.

**Types of Events:**
