### How to Participate in the Diamondz Shadow Ecosystem

## Getting Started

Participating in the Diamondz Shadow ecosystem leverages thirdweb's advanced wallet infrastructure to create a seamless onboarding experience while maintaining the security and functionality of blockchain technology.

## 1. Smart Account Onboarding

Our platform utilizes thirdweb's Smart Wallet technology (ERC-4337 account abstraction) to eliminate traditional barriers:

- **Social Login Authentication**: Sign in with Google, leveraging thirdweb's embedded wallet infrastructure
- **Account Abstraction**: Your wallet is created as a smart contract with enhanced functionality
- **Gasless Transactions**: We cover gas fees through sponsorship, eliminating the need for users to hold native tokens initially
- **Session Keys**: Temporary authorization for specific actions without requiring transaction signing for every interaction
- **Bundled Transactions**: Multiple actions are bundled into a single transaction, improving user experience


To join:

1. Visit our platform
2. Authenticate with Google (or other supported providers)
3. A smart wallet is automatically deployed and linked to your authentication method
4. Begin interacting with the ecosystem immediately without technical setup


## 2. Multi-Token System Architecture

Our ecosystem utilizes four specialized tokens with specific technical implementations:

- **SDM**: ERC-20 gas token for Diamond zChain (launching June 2025)
- **TuBE**: ERC-20 token for content creation and community building
- **GaM3**: ERC-20 token with EIP-2612 permit functionality for gasless approvals in gaming
- **DuSTD**: ERC-20 stablecoin with price feed oracles for maintaining USD peg


## 3. Token Acquisition and Utilization

Thirdweb's wallet infrastructure enables multiple pathways for token interaction:

### SDM (Gas Token)

- **Gasless Sponsorship**: Initial transactions are sponsored through thirdweb's gasless relayer
- **Faucet Integration**: New users receive SDM through an automated faucet connected to their smart wallet
- **Cross-Chain Swaps**: Acquire SDM from other networks using thirdweb's bridge functionality


### TuBE (Content Token)

- **Claim-Drop Mechanics**: Earn TuBE through thirdweb's claim conditions based on contribution metrics
- **Token-Gated Access**: Unlock exclusive content creation tools by holding specific amounts of TuBE
- **Staking Contracts**: Stake TuBE in content projects to earn revenue share from successful productions


### GaM3 (Gaming Token)

- **Gasless Gaming**: Participate in games without transaction prompts through meta-transactions
- **Programmable Distribution**: Receive GaM3 automatically based on in-game achievements
- **Batch Transfers**: Efficiently distribute rewards through batched transactions


### DuSTD (Stablecoin)

- **Permit Functionality**: Approve and transfer in a single transaction
- **Signature Verification**: Authenticate payments without on-chain transactions
- **Recurring Payments**: Set up subscription-style payments for content access


## 4. Technical Participation Mechanisms

Our ecosystem offers multiple technically-enhanced ways to participate:

### Entertainment Participation

## 5. Advanced Governance Implementation

Our governance system leverages thirdweb's DAO infrastructure:

- **Proposal Creation**: Create proposals with thirdweb's proposal contract interface
- **Voting Mechanisms**: Multiple voting strategies including token-weighted, quadratic, and holographic consensus
- **Execution Logic**: Automatic execution of passed proposals through executor contracts
- **Governance NFTs**: Special voting rights represented as non-transferable tokens
- **Tiered Governance**: Different decision types require different quorum and approval thresholds


## 6. Proof of Contribution Technical Implementation

Our Proof of Contribution system utilizes advanced on-chain metrics:

- **Attestation Framework**: Contributions verified through EIP-712 signed attestations
- **Reputation Scoring**: Algorithmic scoring based on contribution quality and quantity
- **Sybil Resistance**: Identity verification through Worldcoin or similar protocols
- **Contribution Oracles**: External data sources verify off-chain contributions
- **Non-Transferable Credentials**: Soul Bound Tokens (SBTs) represent contribution history


## 7. Technical Support Infrastructure

Our support system leverages blockchain technology:

- **Knowledge Base DAO**: Community-maintained documentation with token incentives
- **Support NFTs**: Priority support access through NFT ownership
- **On-Chain Ticketing**: Support requests tracked and resolved on-chain
- **Reputation-Based Rewards**: Community support providers earn based on resolution metrics
